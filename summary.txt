Essentially, for the purposes of that protocol, the data that fed the left-most bar (representing F3) was a T/B ratio instead of the present Bright / Bleft programming, and the goal was to reduce.

Remember, the purpose of that design was to test the inclusion of 3 different measures (related to depression in literature) into one single feedback output. BUT- any one of the three measures have been used and published on as effective interventions.

Meredith, how about you develop a 2 channel protocol that measures the Alpha Amp at both channels separately and that divides the Amp value at right (F4) by the value at left (F3). If output is > 1.1 then give feedback.
